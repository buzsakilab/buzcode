This file describes how to compile the MEX plugins for videoIO on a 32-bit 
Windows platform.  Specifically, videoReader_DirectShow.mexw32 and
videoWriter_DirectShow.mexw32 will be created.  See README.txt for a more 
general description of this library and tips on using it.

Users of 32-bit Windows XP or Windows Vista may try skipping to the 
"Matlab Path" section of this document since precompiled binary mex files are
provided with this distribution.  If there are any errors in running the test
script or if you are using 64-bit Matlab, read this whole document.

Prerequisites:
--------------
This procedure has only been tested with the following software:

 * Windows XP Pro 32-bit        
      It should work with Win2k+, maybe even Win95.  To try it out, you'll need
      to modify WINVER in a few source files.  It should also work fine on 
      32-bit Windows Vista.  64-bit XP Pro and 64-bit Vista running 32-bit 
      Matlab should have no problems.  Running 64-bit Matlab is likely to work,
      but as of July 2007, there are very few 64-bit codecs available.  If you 
      get it to work on one of these platforms, please let us know.  You will 
      probably need administrative privileges to install the 3rd party 
      libraries. 
      
 * Matlab R2006a
      It should work on 6.5 or later, but we have only tested it on R2006a. 
      
 * Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 
      It should work with older versions, perhaps ones as old as Visual 
      Studio 6.  Let us know if you get it to work with an older version.
    
 * Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK (R2)
 * Microsoft DirectX SDK (April 2006)
      Only the DirectShow option is necessary for the Platform SDK.  Download 
      these from http://msdn.microsoft.com (try searching for "Platform SDK" 
      and "DirectX SDK" at their site if you get stuck--they keep moving these 
      downloads around so we do not include a more specific link here).  If you 
      use other versions of the DirectX SDK, it will probably work.  Older 
      versions of the Platform SDK require fixing some compiler 
      incompatibilities in Microsoft's source code (they're straightforward).  
      If you need to use an older version, use the instructions below and 
      adjust the INCLUDE and LIB environment variables whenever the compilation 
      fails.
     
 * Windows Media 9 codec 
      Use Windows Update (http://update.microsoft.com) to obtain the most 
      recent version of Windows Media Player.  This codec is needed for some 
      tests.
 
 * An MPEG4 codec such as DivX, XviD, 3ivx 
 * An H264-compatible codec such as x264
      These codecs are not strictly necessary, but some tests will softly fail 
      if they are not installed.  Here are some places to go for fully legal 
      and free codecs (as of June 2007):
          http://www.3ivx.com/
          http://www.xvid.org/
          http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow-tryout/
          http://developers.videolan.org/x264.html
 
 * Knowledge
      We assume you have at least a passing familiarity with compiling
      C/C++ programs and that you know what environment variables are (or 
      can follow directions exactly).  

       
Installation Instructions:
--------------------------
  1) Add the following paths to your INCLUDE environment variable 
     (Start -> right click on "My Computer" -> "Properties" menu item -> 
     "Advanced" tab -> "Environment Variables" button; edit the INCLUDE 
     variable and add each item to the end, separating each item with a 
     semicolon, if it is not already there).
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Include
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Samples\Multimedia\DirectShow\BaseClasses
       %DXSDK_DIR%\Include
     If the DXSDK_DIR variable does not exist, then you'll need to create it.  
     The file ddraw.h should be found in %DXSDK_DIR%\Include.
       
  2) Add the following to the LIB environment variable
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Lib
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Samples\Multimedia\DirectShow\BaseClasses\WIN2000_RETAIL
       
  3) Add the following to the PATH environment variable
       C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin
       
  4) Accept the environment variable modifications (click "OK" on the dialog 
     box so that only the "System Properties" dialog is still up, or no 
     dialogs).
       
  5) Run the following commands from the command prompt (Start -> Run...
     -> type in "cmd.exe" without quotes):
       cd "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Samples\Multimedia\DirectShow\BaseClasses"
       "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
       nmake NODEBUG=1 _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE=1
     
  6) Start a *new* Matlab session.  You must relaunch Matlab so that it can see
     the new values of the environment variables you have created and/or 
     modified.  Any time you modify environment variables used by Matlab (or 
     programs it calls), you must completely exit Matlab and restart it.
     
  7) In Matlab, run the following if you have not already done so:
       mex -setup
     then edit the file
       C:\Documents and Settings\[your username]\Application Data\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2006a\mexopts.bat
     replacing [your username] with... your username.  On the COMPFLAGS line, 
     add the following:
       -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE
       
  8) In Matlab, run 
       buildVideoIO

Matlab Path
-----------
In Matlab add the base installation directory (but not all subdirectories) to
the path.  In the GUI this can be done by 
  File -> Set Path... -> Add Folder...
From the Matlab command line this can be done using the "addpath" and
"savepath" functions. 
 
Testing
-------
In Matlab, go to the tests/ subdirectory and run
  testAll

Usage:
------
See README.txt for a simple usage example.  Type 
  help buildVideoIO
  help videoReader
  help videoWriter
  help videoread
at the Matlab prompt for user-level documentation.
