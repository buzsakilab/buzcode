Welcome to the Buzsaki lab repository!
The goal is to have this repo as your one-stop-shop for code you may need as a Buzsaki Lab member. This will include preprocessing pipelines as well as analysis functions. Everything will conform to a single (flexible, but documented) database structure.

IMPORTANT: everything is under collective development by the lab.

DATA FORMATTING STANDARDS
(under development: read and contribute to the wiki!)
https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode/wiki/Data-Formatting-Standards

The basic philosophy is built on Neuroscope data formatting, with supplementary .mat types for commonly used data types, each which have a standardized format as outlined in the git wiki. All files pertaining to a given recording should be in a single self-contained folder called baseName. 
For example, /recording7/recording7.ripples.events.mat will be a file containing information about ripples from a recording named recording7, itâ€™s contents will be in the format prescribed to .events.mat type files. 

As you (inevitably) run into data types that don't really fit into any of these boxes, please consult the #code-development channel at buzsakilab.slack.com/messages/code-development/, and add the necessary format/standards to the wiki.
