# npy-matlab

Code to read/write NumPy .NPY files in MATLAB


## Usage example:
```
>> a = rand(5,4,3);
>> writeNPY(a, 'a.npy');
>> b = readNPY('a.npy');
>> sum(a(:)==b(:))
ans =

    60
```

## Tests
[See the notebook for python tests](npy.ipynb)

See test_readNPY.m for matlab reading/writing tests. 

## Note re: memory mapping npy files
See exampleMemmap.m for example of how to memory map a npy file in matlab, which is not trivial when the file uses C-ordering (i.e. row-major order) rather than fortran-ordering (i.e. column-major ordering). Matlab's memory mapping only supports fortran, but Python's default is C so npy files created with Python defaults are not straightforward to read in Matlab.
