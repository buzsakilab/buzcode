 INTRODUCTION
 ============
 
 XMLTree is an XML toolbox for MATLAB (version 5.3 or later).
 This package consists of a class xmltree, of XML-files examples
 and of 3 scripts of demonstrations.

 This toolbox contains an XML 1.0 processor (or parser), which aims
 to be fully conforming. It is currently not a validating processor.
 See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml>
 for details on XML.

 This processor is encapsulated in a MATLAB class allowing for the
 manipulation of an XMLTree object through an object oriented way.
 Several functions have been designed for this purpose.

 If you do not wish to use the whole class but are solely interested
 in the XML parser, then you can only use functions that are in the
 private folder of the class @xmltree/private: xml_parser.m and a
 compiled version of xml_findstr.m.

 Suggestions for improvement and fixes are always welcome, although no 
 guarantee is made whether and when they will be implemented.

 INSTALLATION
 ============
 
 1) Download <xmltree.zip> from here:
 
    <http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/xml/>

 2) Extract files from the zip archive:
 
    >> unzip xmltree.zip

 3) Add the new path to MATLAB (assuming you extracted the toolbox
    in '/home/guillaume/Documents/MATLAB/'):

    >> addpath('/home/guillaume/Documents/MATLAB/xmltree/');
    
    Note that the directory @xmltree doesn't need to be added in MATLAB 
    path, since it's a class directory. 

 4) XMLTree package uses one MEX-file for the parsing of XML data: 
    this MEX-file is provided for Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.
    If you need to compile it for your own architecture, the command is:

    >> cd /home/guillaume/Documents/MATLAB/@xmltree/private/
    >> mex -O xml_findstr.c

    If never this compiled function doesn't work or behaves badly, 
    comment the line #define __HACK_MXCHAR__ at the beginning of the 
    file, and compile it again.

 TUTORIAL
 ========
 
 Look at the examples scripts (xmldemo*.m) for a walkthrough of how
 to use the xmltree class:

 >> xmldemo1
 >> xmldemo2
 >> xmldemo3
