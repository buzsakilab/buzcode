This is a readme file for the SOFA API for Matlab and Octave.

* When adding SOFA API to Matlab search path: Use "Add Folder", don't use "Add with Subfolders"
* Start the API: execute "SOFAstart" in Matlab or Octave.
* No HRTF files to play around? Follow the advices in the readme.txt files in the HRTFs directories.
* Explore the API: execute some of the "demo_" files in the directory "demos".
* Learn more about SOFA: read the specs PDF in the directory "doc".
* Report a bug: send a ticket at https://sf.net/p/sofacoustics/.
* Last changes? check the file "history.txt".

Tested with Matlab R2013a (and higher) and Octave 3.6.
