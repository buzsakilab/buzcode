function [azi,ele] = sph2nav(azi,ele)
%SPH2NAV  Coordinate Transform
%   [azi,ele] = sph2nav(azi,ele) converts spherical coordinates to
%   navigational coordinates.
%
%   Input:
%       azi ... azimuth (0 <= azi < 360)
%       ele ... elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
%
%   Output:
%       azi ... azimuth (-180 <= azi <= 180)
%       ele ... elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
