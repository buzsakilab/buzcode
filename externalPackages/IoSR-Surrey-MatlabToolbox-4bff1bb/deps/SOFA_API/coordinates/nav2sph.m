function [azi,ele]=nav2sph(azi,ele)
%NAV2SPH Coordinate Transform.
%	[azi,ele] = nav2sph(azi,ele) vonverts navigational coordinates to
%	spherical coordinates.
%
%	Input:
%       azi ... azimuth (-180 <= azi <= 180)
%       ele ... elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
%
%   Output:
%       azi ... azimuth (0 <= azi < 360)
%       ele ... elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
