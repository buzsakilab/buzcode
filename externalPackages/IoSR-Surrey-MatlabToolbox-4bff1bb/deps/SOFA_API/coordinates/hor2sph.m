function [azi,ele]=hor2sph(lat,pol)
%HOR2SPH  transform horizontal-polar to spherical coordinates.
%   [azi,ele]=hor2sph(lat,pol)
% 
%   Input:
%       lat ... lateral angle (-90 <= lat <= 90)
%       pol ... polar angle (-90 <= pol < 270)
% 
%   Output:
%       azi ... azimuth (0 <= azi < 360)
%       ele ... elevation (-90 <= ele <= 90)
%
