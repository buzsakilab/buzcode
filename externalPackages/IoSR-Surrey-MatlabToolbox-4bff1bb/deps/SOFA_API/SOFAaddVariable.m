function Obj = SOFAaddVariable(Obj,Name,Dim,Value)
%SOFAaddVariable
%   Obj = SOFAaddVariable(Obj,Name,Dim,Value) adds a user-defined variable
%   to the SOFA structure OBJ. NAME must be a string with the variable name 
%   ('API', 'PRIVATE', or 'GLOBAL' are not allowed). DIM is a string 
%   describing the dimensions of the variable according to SOFA specifications. 
%   The content of NAME is stored in VALUE which must be of the size DIM. 
%   The used-defined variable NAME will be stored as Obj.NAME and its
%   dimension will be stored as Obj.API.Dimensions.NAME. Note that user-
%   defined variables can be saved in SOFA file and thus remain in the 
%   object when loaded from a SOFA file. 
%
%   Obj = SOFAaddVariable(Obj,Name,'PRIVATE',Value) adds a private variable
%   to OBJ. The private variable NAME will be stored as Obj.PRIVATE.NAME. 
%   Note that the private variables will be not stored in SOFA files and
%   arbitrary dimensions are allowed.
%
%		Note that adding variables to Data is not supported and should not be used
%		as it might be confusing having user-defined variables in a Data structure. 
%		Consider adding a variable at the global level instead, which would be more
%		clear for others.

% 9.8.2014: dimension is added if not previously found.
